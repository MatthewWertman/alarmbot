# Alarmbot
A simple discord bot that can keep track of time for you.

# About
This is not a serious project as it is not entirely useful. This is still under delevopment and will probably recieve more infrequent updates as time goes on because this is not a long-term project. 

# Getting started
These instructions will help you get a copy of AlarmBot and run it on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
  * **[Node.js v12.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** or later

## Installing
Enter the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/MatthewWertman/alarmbot.git AlarmBot/
cd AlarmBot
npm install --save
```

### Initial Setup
Rename the config.js.example to config.js.

After that, Add your Discord ID and your bot Token to the config.js file.

More details on how to get a bot token here(also has a pretty cool repo): https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token

## Running the bot
Using node
```
node .\index.js
```

## Configuration
You can either run the settings command (NOTE: the bot has to restart) or you can edit the config file directly.
